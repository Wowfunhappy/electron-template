A simple Electron wrapper that can turn static websites into apps. Place the website in /src/site.

Uses Electron 3.1.13 to maintain compatibility with OS X 10.9 Mavericks.

See also: https://github.com/Wowfunhappy/Firefox-Dynasty-Web-App-Template which is currently my preferred solution for making OS X apps out of websites (although it currently loads only live websites over the internet, not static ones from within the app bundle). 

P.S. Electron is terrible. However, there are apps I want to have on my computer, which means I need to make them, and I have limited time, and this is a way to make apps quickly.
